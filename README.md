## How to use
### 1. Using CDN
Call the css using this code on your html file by pasting this code.
```css
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/neuicons/neu.css">
```
or try this template to take a look.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

  <title>Neu Test</title>
  
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/neuicons/neu.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- example icon -->
    <i class="neu-emoji" style="font-size: 24px;"></i> 
  </body>

</html>
```
### 2. Node
>If you want to use it with CDN, you can skip this installation.
```shell
npm install neuicons --save
```
*I have a basic understanding about this method actually. I prefer you to use the CDN one instead. I will give clear update once I understand it.
